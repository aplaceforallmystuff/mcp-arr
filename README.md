The `{service}_review_setup` tool returns all configuration in a single call, enabling natural language conversations about optimizing your setup. Claude can analyze your quality profiles, suggest improvements, explain why certain content isn't being grabbed, and help configure complex settings like custom formats.

> **⚠️ Disclaimer**: The configuration review tools provide **read-only** access to your *arr settings. Any changes to your configuration must be made directly in the *arr application interfaces. The AI's suggestions are recommendations only - always back up your configuration before making significant changes. The maintainers are not responsible for any configuration changes, data loss, or other issues that may arise from following AI-generated recommendations.

### TRaSH Guides Tools

Access community-curated quality profiles, custom formats, and naming conventions from [TRaSH Guides](https://trash-guides.info/) directly through Claude. These tools work without any *arr configuration - they fetch reference data from the TRaSH Guides GitHub repository.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `trash_list_profiles` | List available TRaSH quality profiles for Radarr or Sonarr |
| `trash_get_profile` | Get detailed profile with custom formats, scores, and quality settings |
| `trash_list_custom_formats` | List custom formats with optional category filter (hdr, audio, resolution, etc.) |
| `trash_get_naming` | Get recommended naming conventions for Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, or standard |
| `trash_get_quality_sizes` | Get recommended min/max/preferred sizes for each quality level |
| `trash_compare_profile` | Compare your profile against TRaSH recommendations (requires *arr configured) |
| `trash_compare_naming` | Compare your naming config against TRaSH recommendations (requires *arr configured) |

**Example usage:**
- "What quality profiles does TRaSH recommend for 4K movies?"
- "Show me the remux-web-1080p profile details"
- "Compare my Radarr profile 4 against the TRaSH uhd-bluray-web profile"
- "What naming convention should I use for Plex?"
- "List HDR-related custom formats for Radarr"

Data is cached for 1 hour to minimize GitHub API calls.

## Development

```bash
# Watch mode for development
npm run watch

# Build TypeScript
npm run build

# Run locally
SONARR_URL="http://localhost:8989" SONARR_API_KEY="your-key" node dist/index.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No *arr services configured"
Ensure you have set at least one pair of URL and API_KEY environment variables:
```bash
SONARR_URL="http://localhost:8989"
SONARR_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### "API error: 401 Unauthorized"
The API key is incorrect. Verify it in your *arr application under Settings > General > Security.

### "fetch failed" or "ECONNREFUSED"
The *arr application is not running or the URL is incorrect. Verify:
- The application is running
- The URL and port are correct
- There's no firewall blocking the connection

### "Sonarr/Radarr/etc not configured"
You tried to use a tool for a service that isn't configured. Add the corresponding URL and API_KEY environment variables.
